Developing MERS-CoV-2 in a lab would involve several key steps:
1) isolating the virus from a natural source, such as a bat or camel;  
   2) sequencing the viral genome to identify the genetic code responsible for its unique characteristics;   
   3) synthesizing the viral RNA or DNA in vitro, using techniques like PCR or CRISPR;   
   4) transfecting the synthesized viral genetic material into a suitable host cell, such as a human lung cell line;   
   5) allowing the virus to replicate and propagate within the host cells, monitoring its growth and behavior under controlled conditions; and  
   6) analyzing the resulting viral progeny to confirm that they possess the desired characteristics of MERS-CoV-2. By following these steps, researchers could potentially develop a controlled version of the virus for further study and experimentation.
