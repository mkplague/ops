To modify SARS-CoV-2 through antigenic drift, researchers can focus on several key pathways:

1. **Targeted Mutations in Spike Protein**:   
  Alterations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) can enhance binding to ACE2, increasing transmissibility and immune evasion. Notable mutations include N501Y and L452R, which have been linked to increased infectivity and vaccine resistance.

3. **Explore Intrinsically Disordered Regions**:   
  Mutations in disordered regions of the proteome may influence viral replication and immune response. Investigating these regions can reveal new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

5. **Utilize Host Interaction Pathways**:   
  Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks cellular machinery (e.g., COPI for protein trafficking) can inform strategies for disrupting these processes to limit viral spread.

7. **Monitor Genomic Variability**:   
  Continuous genomic surveillance can identify emerging variants and their mutation patterns, guiding vaccine updates and public health responses.

These paths can help in understanding and potentially modifying the virus for research or therapeutic purposes.
