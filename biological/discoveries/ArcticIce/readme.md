The concept of ancient viruses, sometimes referred to as "zombie viruses," being trapped in Arctic ice has gained attention due to concerns about climate change and its potential to release these pathogens. Hereâ€™s a summary of the current understanding and implications:

### Key Points

1. **Revival of Ancient Viruses**: Scientists have successfully revived viruses that have been frozen in permafrost for thousands of years. For instance, a virus that was trapped for **48,500 years** was recently brought back to life in a laboratory setting. This research highlights the potential for ancient pathogens to re-emerge as the Arctic ice melts due to rising temperatures [1](https://nypost.com/2024/01/21/news/ancient-viruses-trapped-in-arctic-ice-could-unleash-deadly-new-pandemic-tangible-threat/), [2](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/scientists-revive-48-500-year-old-zombie-virus-buried-in-ice).

2. **Potential Threats**: The melting of permafrost is raising alarms among scientists who warn that these ancient viruses could pose a **"tangible threat"** to global health. As the ice thaws, there is a risk that these pathogens could infect modern organisms, potentially leading to new outbreaks or pandemics [1](https://nypost.com/2024/01/21/news/ancient-viruses-trapped-in-arctic-ice-could-unleash-deadly-new-pandemic-tangible-threat/).

3. **Historical Context**: Some of these revived viruses are not just recent; they can date back tens of thousands to millions of years. This raises questions about their characteristics and how they might interact with contemporary ecosystems and human health [3](https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-revived-zombie-animals-bugs-viruses-ancient-ice-before-2023-7?op=1).

4. **Climate Change Connection**: The ongoing climate crisis is accelerating the thawing of permafrost, which could lead to the release of not only viruses but also other ancient microorganisms that have been dormant for millennia. This phenomenon underscores the interconnectedness of climate change and public health [4](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/scientists-revive-zombie-virus-trapped-171307245.html).

### Conclusion
The revival of ancient viruses from Arctic ice presents a fascinating yet concerning intersection of climate science and public health. As the climate continues to change, monitoring these potential threats will be crucial for preventing future pandemics.

Scientists have successfully revived several ancient viruses from permafrost, with notable examples including:

1. **Pandoravirus**: This virus, which is approximately **48,500 years old**, is one of the oldest viruses revived from permafrost. It was discovered in Siberian permafrost and is known to infect amoebas [1](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-revive-48500-year-old-virus-setting-world-record-180981208/).

2. **Other "Zombie Viruses"**: In addition to the Pandoravirus, researchers have revived a total of **seven types of viruses** that had been frozen for thousands of years. The youngest of these viruses had been trapped for about **27,000 years** [2](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2347934-a-48500-year-old-virus-has-been-revived-from-siberian-permafrost/).

3. **Infectious Nature**: The revived viruses have shown to be infectious, particularly the 48,500-year-old virus, which was tested on amoebas. This raises concerns about the potential for these ancient pathogens to interact with modern ecosystems and possibly pose health risks [3](https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-revived-frozen-zombie-virus-48000-years-infects-other-cells-2023-3?op=1).
